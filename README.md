# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build a various of different financial models using python. I built a Comparable Companies model, a DCF model, and a simple LBO model as in demonstration. 

## Comparable Companies Analysis Model

In this notebook, I used FinancialModelingPrep's API to retrieve a various of financial and valuation metrics for UHS, CVS, ANTM, CI, HUM, CNC, and MOH in the healthcare insurance space. Since, I am using a free API that is quite unstable, I am not able to retrieve all the valuation metrics for the selected companies all at once. If you are also using a free API, the best way to do this, is to comment all the other metrics, only retrieve the first metric, run it and write it to xlsx file, then repeat until you have all the valuation metrics you need for your comparable companies analysis model. 

## Discounted Cash Flow Model 

The assumptions and the Income Statement I used are based on one of the deals I was working on in the past. This is a very simple DCF model I built using python. This model can be used as pre-valuation stage as to figure out quickly what the target company is worth. I also built a monte carlo simulation that run 1000 iterations to calculate the TEV. 

## LBO Model

This model is adapted from one of the case studies provided by BreakingIntoWallStreet. It is an hour long CS. The assumptions in my model are based on the instructions provided in the CS. 

## Future Work 

As of now, these models are all standalone. In the future, I hope to create a more complicated DCF model and incorporated the median multiples from the comparable companies analysis model to calculate the terminal value via multiples method.
